### A note about the examples below

The examples below are for the 2.44.1 release. Modify the version
number for the actual release.

### Using a fork or a clone of the original repo

The instructions below can be used from a fork (recommended) or from a
clone of the master repo.

### Deciding the release version number

This project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Before making the release, it must be decided if it is a *major*, *minor* or
*patch* release.

#### Stable release versions and development versions numbering convention

See [`gen_version.py`](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/blob/master/gen_version.py).

### Instructions

#### Creating the release

1. Check that the
[master pipeline](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/pipelines?ref=master)
is green

1. Create a local branch and name it e.g. `stable-release-<version>`

   Example: `stable-release-2.44.1`

1. Edit `gen_version.py` according to instructions in that file.

1. Edit `CHANGELOG.md`

    Add the new version between `[Unreleased]` and the previous
    version.

    At the bottom of the file, add an entry for the new version. These
    entries are not visible in the rendered page, but are essential
    for the version links to the GitLab commit comparisons to work.

    Example (from
    [commit 5e0d3b1841b7e358274c916b52276d251eabef3d](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/commit/5e0d3b1841b7e358274c916b52276d251eabef3d#ab09011fa121d0a2bb9fa4ca76094f2482b902b7)):

    ```diff
     ## [Unreleased]
     
    +## [2.44.1] - 2020-06-29
    +
    ```

    ```diff
    -[Unreleased]: https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/compare/2.44.0...master
    +[Unreleased]: https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/compare/2.44.1...master
    +[2.44.1]: https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/compare/2.44.0...2.44.1
     [2.44.0]: https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/compare/2.42.4...2.44.0
     [2.42.4]: https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/compare/2.42.3...2.42.4
     [2.42.3]: https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/compare/2.42.2...2.42.3
    ```

1. Commit:

   `git add -p`

   `git commit -m "Stable Release 2.44.1"`

1. Push:

   Example: `git push origin stable-release-2.44.1`

1. Wait until the pipeline has run for your branch and check that it's green

1. Create a merge request

1. Merge the merge request

1. Wait for the
[master pipeline](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/pipelines?ref=master)
  to run for the new commit and check that it's green

1. The “deployment” CI task will automatically create a release on the
   [Gitlab releases tab](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/releases). If a
   release is not created, check that your modifications to `gen_version.py`
   correctly set a version conforming to the regular expression `\d+\.\d+\.\d+`.
   The “deployment” CI task will also create a Git tag for the version, e.g.
   `2.44.1`.

#### Returning to the development series

1. Create a new local branch and name it e.g. `return-to-<version>-dev`

   Example: `return-to-2.45-dev`

1. Edit `gen_version.py` again according to instructions in that file.

1. Commit:

    `git add -p`

    If patch version was incremented:

    Example: `git commit -m "Move back to 2.45 development series"`

    else (if major or minor version was incremented):

    Example: `git commit -m "Start 2.47 development series"`

1. Push:

   Example: `git push origin return-to-2.45-dev`

1. Wait until the pipeline has run for your new branch and check that it's green

1. Create a merge request

1. Merge the merge request

#### Updating the website

1. Fork the
   [Graphviz website repository](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io)
   if you do not already have a fork of it

1. Checkout the latest master branch

1. Create a local branch

1. Update the download pages, download.md and download/source/index.md, with
   details of the new release

1. Commit this to your local branch

1. Push this to a branch in your fork

1. Create a merge request

1. Wait for CI to pass

1. Merge the merge request

## Building

Instructions for building Graphviz from source are available
[on the public website](https://graphviz.org/download/source/). However, if you
are building Graphviz from a repository clone for the purpose of testing changes
you are making, you will want to follow different steps.

### Autotools build system

```sh
# generate the configure script for setting up the build
./autogen.sh

# you probably do not want to install your development version of Graphviz over
# the top of your system binaries/libraries, so create a temporary directory as
# an install destination
PREFIX=$(mktemp -d)

# configure the build system
./configure --prefix=${PREFIX}

# if this is the first time you are building Graphviz from source, you should
# inspect the output of ./configure and make sure it is what you expected

# compile Graphviz binaries and libraries
make

# install everything to the temporary directory
make install
```

### CMake build system

Note that Graphviz’ CMake build system is incomplete. It only builds a subset
of the binaries and libraries. For most code-related changes, you will probably
want to test using Autotools or MSBuild instead.

However, if you do want to use CMake:

```sh
# make a scratch directory to store build artifacts
mkdir build
cd build

# you probably do not want to install your development version of Graphviz over
# the top of your system binaries/libraries, so create a temporary directory as
# an install destination
PREFIX=$(mktemp -d)

# configure the build system
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${PREFIX} ..

# compile Graphviz binaries and libraries
make

# install everything to the temporary directory
make install
```

### Microsoft Build Engine

TODO

## Testing

The Graphviz test suite uses [pytest](https://pytest.org/). This is not because
of any Python-related specifics in Graphviz, but rather because pytest is a
convenient framework.

If you have compiled Graphviz and installed to a custom location, as described
above, then you can run the test suite from the root of a Graphviz checkout as
follows:

```sh
# run the Graphviz test suite, making the temporary installation visible to it
env PATH=${PREFIX}/bin:${PATH} C_INCLUDE_PATH=${PREFIX}/include \
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${PREFIX}/lib LIBRARY_PATH=${PREFIX}/lib \
  MANPATH=${PREFIX}/share/man \
  python3 -m pytest tests rtest --verbose
```

*TODO: on macOS and Windows, you probably need to override different environment variables?*

## Performance and profiling

The runtime and memory usage of Graphviz is dependent on the user’s graph. It is
easy to create “expensive” graphs without realizing it using only moderately
sized input. For this reason, users regularly encounter performance bottlenecks
that they need help with. This situation is likely to persist even with hardware
advances, as the size and complexity of the graphs users construct will expand
as well.

This section documents how to build performance-optimized Graphviz binaries and
how to identify performance bottlenecks. Note that this information assumes you
are working in a Linux environment.

### Building an optimized Graphviz

The first step to getting an optimized build is to make sure you are using a
recent compiler. If you have not upgraded your C and C++ compilers for a while,
make sure you do this first.

The simplest way to change flags used during compilation is by setting the
`CFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS` environment variables:

```sh
env CFLAGS="..." CXXFLAGS="..." ./configure
```

You should use the maximum optimization level for your compiler. E.g. `-O3` for
GCC and Clang. If your toolchain supports it, it is recommended to also enable
link-time optimization (`-flto`). You should also disable runtime assertions
with `-DNDEBUG`.

You can further optimize compilation for the machine you are building on with
`-march=native -mtune=native`. Be aware that the resulting binaries will no
longer be portable (may not run if copied to another machine). These flags are
also not recommended if you are debugging a user issue, because you will end up
profiling and optimizing different code than what may execute on their machine.

Most profilers need a symbol table and/or debugging metadata to give you useful
feedback. You can enable this on GCC and Clang with `-g`.

Putting this all together:

```sh
env CFLAGS="-O3 -flto -DNDEBUG -march=native -mtune=native -g" \
  CXXFLAGS="-O3 -flto -DNDEBUG -march=native -mtune=native -g" ./configure
```

### Profiling

#### [Callgrind](https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cl-manual.html)

Callgrind is a tool of [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) that can measure how
many times a function is called and how expensive the execution of a function is
compared to overall runtime. When you have built an optimized binary according
to the above instructions, you can run it under Callgrind:

```sh
valgrind --tool=callgrind dot -Tsvg test.dot
```

This will produce a file like callgrind.out.2534 in the current directory. You
can use [Kcachegrind](https://kcachegrind.github.io/) to view the results by
running it in the same directory with no arguments:

```sh
kcachegrind
```

If you have multiple trace results in the current directory, Kcachegrind will
load all of them and even let you compare them to each other. See the
Kcachegrind documentation for more information about how to use this tool.

Be aware that execution under Callgrind will be a lot slower than a normal run.
If you need to see instruction-level execution costs, you can pass
`--dump-instr=yes` to Valgrind, but this will further slow execution and is
usually not necessary. To profile with less overhead, you can use a statistical
profiler like Linux Perf.
